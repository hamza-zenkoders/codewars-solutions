// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

// Problem URL: https://www.codewars.com/kata/523f5d21c841566fde000009/javascript

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  for (let i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {
      if (b[i] === a[j]) {
        a.splice(j, 1);
        --j;
      }
    }
  }
  return a;
}
